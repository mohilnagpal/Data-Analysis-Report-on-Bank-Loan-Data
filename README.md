# Data-Analysis-Report-on-Bank-Loan-Data

Created a report performing descriptive analysis with the help of
libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly by plotting bar charts, pie charts and box plots on python. 

Pre-processed data by removing negative experience values and dropping columns not required for analysis.

the impact of income on a customers appetite to take on loan.
the relation between the age of the customer and it's willingness to take on loan.
if or not the number of members in the family influence the customer's decision to take a loan.
